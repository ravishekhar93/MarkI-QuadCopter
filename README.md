# MarkI-QuadCopter
Arduino Code of My First Drone Build + HC-05

This code is a derived version of Joop Brooking's Code(http://www.brokking.net/). 
It has been adapted to use blutetooth as a transiver, unlike traditinal RF.
Also, it Employs a 10DOF sensor, while the original used MPU6050.

Features:
  -Loop Time is well within 4ms. Hence a 250Hz cycle.
  -It's paired with a custom build Android App.
  -BodySync feature enables it to mimic phone's orientation.
  -Can easily be swapped from blutooth to wifi, if need be.
